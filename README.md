# AD-Game-Project
This project aims to implement the traditional African game of Awalé (also known as Oware or Wure in Wolof) using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in C#

Awalé is a strategy board game popular across West and Southern Africa, known for its rich cultural heritage and profound strategic depth. The game involves two players, each managing seeds across twelve pits (six per side) with the goal of capturing more seeds than the opponent.

#Features
Game Logic: Implements the traditional rules of Awalé, handling seed sowing, capturing, and game-ending conditions.
AI Opponent: An AI opponent for single-player mode, with varying levels of difficulty.
Multiplayer: Local (same device) multiplayer support.
GUI: A graphical user interface (GUI) that visually represents the game board and allows for intuitive interaction.
Cultural Insight: Includes background information on the cultural significance of Awalé in African societies.

#Goals
To provide an interactive and engaging way to experience playing Awalé.
To apply and demonstrate OOP principles and design patterns in a real-world project.
To preserve and share an important aspect of African cultural heritage.
